A comprehensive solution for migrating encrypted Roam Research graphs while preserving all media files and attachments. This tool solves the long-standing issue of broken media links when exporting encrypted Roam graphs.

## üéØ The Problem

When you export an encrypted Roam Research graph:
1. The backup is decrypted during export (which is good)
2. You also have to manually export all media files (images, PDFs, etc.) to a local folder
3. **BUT** the links in the JSON still point to encrypted Firebase URLs (`.enc` files)
4. When you import this backup, all media files appear broken

This has been a major pain point for the Roam community for years, preventing users from:
- Creating true backups of encrypted graphs
- Migrating between tools
- Forking graphs with media
- Moving from encrypted to unencrypted graphs

## ‚ú® The Solution

This tool:
1. **Uploads** all exported media files to Cloudflare R2 (or any S3-compatible storage)
2. **Processes** the exported JSON to replace all Firebase URLs with your new URLs
3. **Handles** all edge cases including:
   - Files with special naming patterns (`-image`, numeric suffixes like `-44306`)
   - Files with spaces and special characters
   - PDFs, images, videos, and other attachments
   - Large graphs with thousands of files
4. **Maintains** traceability by keeping original filenames (or using secure hashes)
5. **Supports** resume capability if the process is interrupted

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- A Cloudflare account with R2 enabled (or compatible S3 storage)
- Your exported Roam Research backup

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rodrigo-kiko/roam-encrypted-migration.git
cd roam-encrypted-migration

# Install dependencies
pip install requests
```

### Setting up Cloudflare R2

1. **Create a Cloudflare account** (if you don't have one)
2. **Enable R2**:
   - Go to R2 in your Cloudflare dashboard
   - Create a new bucket (e.g., `roam-media`)
   - Enable public access: Settings ‚Üí R2.dev subdomain ‚Üí Allow access
   - Copy the public URL (e.g., `https://pub-xxxxx.r2.dev`)

3. **Create an API token**:
   - Go to My Profile ‚Üí API Tokens
   - Create Token ‚Üí Custom Token
   - Permissions: Account - Workers R2 Storage:Edit
   - Copy the token (you'll only see it once!)

4. **Get your Account ID**:
   - It's in the URL when you're in the Cloudflare dashboard
   - Or in the right sidebar of your account home

### Basic Usage

```bash
python roam_migration.py \
  --token YOUR_CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN \
  --account YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID \
  --bucket your-bucket-name \
  --url https://pub-xxxxx.r2.dev \
  --files "/path/to/Files and images" \
  --json /path/to/your-backup.json
```

## üìñ Detailed Guide

### Step 1: Export Your Roam Graph

1. In Roam Research, click the three dots menu ‚Üí Export All
2. Choose "JSON" format
3. Select "Export all"
4. Download and extract the ZIP file
5. In Roam Research, click the three dots menu ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Files ‚Üí Download All Files

You'll get a folder structure like:
```
Roam Export/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Your-Graph-Name-2024-08-16.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Files and images/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ image1.png
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ document.pdf
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (all your media files)
```

### Step 2: Run the Migration

```bash
# Full example with real paths
python roam_migration.py \
  --token abcd1234567890 \
  --account xyz987654321 \
  --bucket roam-backup \
  --url https://pub-abc123.r2.dev \
  --files "/Users/john/Downloads/Roam Export/Files and images" \
  --json "/Users/john/Downloads/Roam Export/MyGraph-2024-08-16.json"
```

The tool will:
1. Test the API connection
2. Build a cache of all local files
3. Upload each file (showing progress)
4. Update all links in the JSON
5. Save the migrated JSON file
6. Display a summary

### Step 3: Import the Migrated Graph

1. Create a new graph in Roam Research (or your target tool)
2. Import the `*_migrated.json` file
3. All your media files should now load correctly!

## üéØ Use Cases

### 1. Backup Encrypted Graphs
Create a true backup of your encrypted Roam graph with all media intact.

### 2. Migrate to Other Tools
Export from Roam and import to:
- Obsidian (with media links working)
- Logseq
- Tana
- RemNote
- Athens Research
- Any tool that accepts Roam JSON

### 3. Fork Graphs
Create a copy of your graph with all media files accessible.

### 4. Decrypt Graphs
Move from an encrypted graph to an unencrypted one without losing media.

### 5. Archive Projects
Create a complete archive of a project graph with all attachments.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "API Token Invalid"
- Ensure your token has `Workers R2 Storage:Edit` permission
- Check that you're using the correct account ID

### "Files not found"
- Verify the path to "Files and images" folder is correct
- Ensure you're using the extracted folder, not the ZIP

### "Links still broken after import"
- Check that your R2 bucket has public access enabled
- Verify the public URL is correct
- Test a file URL directly in your browser

### Large Graphs (1000+ files)
- The tool handles large graphs efficiently
- Expect ~30-60 minutes for 2000+ files
- Progress is saved every 50 files by default
